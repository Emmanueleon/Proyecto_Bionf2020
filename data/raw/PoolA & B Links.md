Because of the size of the files I decided to upload the raw content in OSF page, here are the links of each file for the Pool A and Pool B.
I tried to download it with a `wget` or` curl` command, but it got complicated, so I decided to put the direct links here.

**Pool A**:
 * [R1](https://osf.io/utw8n/) 
 * [R2](https://osf.io/3h4fr/)

**Pool B**:
 * [R1](https://osf.io/vrfnm/)
 * [R2](https://osf.io/hjnb6/)
